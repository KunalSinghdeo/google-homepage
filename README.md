First try at the web project!

What I've learned: 
  - using grid and commands like a:link - both are awesome!
  - finally getting know the difference between padding and margin!
  - after some break due to intense time at my day job, I have enjoyed this getting back to this project much more than I expected!
  
What could have done better:
  - sizing/spacing of the elements relative to the page size
  - hover effect over the search bar
  - some spacing of elements in general.
